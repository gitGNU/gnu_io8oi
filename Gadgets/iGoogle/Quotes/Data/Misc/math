A mathematician is a device for turning coffee into theorems. ~Paul Erdos
Go down deep enough into anything and you will find mathematics.  ~Dean Schlicter
God does not care about our mathematical difficulties; He integrates empirically.  ~Albert Einstein
If I have seen a little further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants. ~Newton
If people do not believe that mathematics is simple, it is only because they do not realize how complicated life is.  ~John Louis von Neumann
If there is a God, he's a great mathematician.  ~Paul Dirac
It is not the job of mathematicians... to do correct arithmetical operations.  It is the job of bank accountants.  ~Samuil Shchatunovski
Mathematics are well and good but nature keeps dragging us around by the nose.  ~Albert Einstein
Mathematics is as much an aspect of culture as it is a collection of algorithms.  ~Carl Boyer, 1949, calculus textbook
Mathematics is one of the few disciplines that teaches us about the power of thought as distinct from the power of authority. ~math.gmu.edu
Mathematics is the supreme judge; from its decisions there is no appeal.  ~Tobias Dantzig
Pure mathematics is the world's best game. It is more absorbing than chess, more of a gamble than poker, and lasts longer than Monopoly.  It's free. ~Richard J. Trudeau, Dots and Lines
Pure mathematics is, in its way, the poetry of logical ideas.  ~Albert Einstein
So if a man's wit be wandering, let him study the mathematics -- ~Francis Bacon, "Of Studies"
Still more astonishing is that world of rigorous fantasy we call mathematics.  ~Gregory Bateson
The essence of mathematics is not to make simple things complicated, but to make complicated things simple.  ~S. Gudder
The laws of nature are but the mathematical thoughts of God.  ~Euclid
The man ignorant of mathematics will be increasingly limited in his grasp of the main forces of civilization.  ~John Kemeny
The only advice we offer to new researchers is read! read! read! many papers with complete proofs. ~Iwaniec & Kowalski
Wir müssen wissen. Wir werden wissen.  ~David Hilbert
Young man, in mathematics you don't understand things. You just get used to them. ~John von Neumann
[G]eometry is not true, it is advantageous.  ~Henri Poincaré
[T]he different branches of Arithmetic - Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.  ~Lewis Carroll
