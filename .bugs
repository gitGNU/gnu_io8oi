PLANS
-----
- find out reasons why some URLs become BROKEN
- different search modes like Vi/M's v-i-n
- general search quality metrics such as Pscore, mCPC and thresh
- correlation matrix, --
- targeted search change-metric, try stochastic processes such as martingales/m.chains
- consistency checks : tree-model, function-model, comparison model -- some like RM-DM-RD values, more here http://www.hipre.hut.fi/
- correlation metric, try ssdeep
