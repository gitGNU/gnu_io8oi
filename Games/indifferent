# Description: 
# You are indifferent to assets X.
# X can refer to urls, other IPs, financial portfolios or anything easily analyzed.
# The term 'easily analyzed' is subjective by definition because each actor is different.
# The difference means that you see things totally different to an actor O.
# So you need to create model that fits you Z, O and (Y actors).
# 
# Please, note that this problem can be hard, not all types of beasts can be parametrized.
# So if your portfolio or friendship connections are too complicated, you will fail or you must approximate.
# If you stil cannot understand, please, see indifference curves at Economics.

# Topics: minimal surfaces, optimization, convexity, numerical analysis, indifference curves
